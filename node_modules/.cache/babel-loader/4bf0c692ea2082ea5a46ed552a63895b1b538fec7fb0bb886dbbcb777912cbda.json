The name Drukgyel refers to “Druk,” the name of the country its people in its local vernacular, and “gyel,” meaning “victory” or “victorious.” When the invasions finally ended, Drukgyel Dzong became an important stop for traders. Rice was the main export to Tibet, and salt and tea were the main goods imported from Tibet, and caravans would stop by Drukgyel Dzong before tackling the Tremo La pass.\n    \n              The Drukgyel Dzong structure consists of a tall central building and an adjacent courtyard surrounded by lower buildings. The fort takes full advantage of the terrain. It’s located on top of a hill with steep cliffs on three sides, leaving only one side of the structure vulnerable to attack. A fortified wall with several derelict watchtowers surrounds it. There used to be tunnels connecting the dzong with the river to decrease the risk of fetching water during battle, but these tunnels are now sealed.\n    \n              In 1951, Drukgyel Dzong was almost completely destroyed by a fire, and what remained was left to the elements until restoration work began in 2016.</p>\n          <br />\n          <h2 className='font-bold'>Paro Rinpung Dzong</h2>\n          <br />\n          <p>Paro Dzong was built in 1644 by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel, the “unifier of Bhutan”.

Opened in 1968, its collection of fine arts, paintings and bronzes are famous. There are also textiles, jewelry, and handicrafts sections as well as galleries of stuffed animals and butterflies from Bhutan. The stamps’ hall is very popular and displays, among others, 3-D stamps, record stamps, silken stamps, embossed stamps and the famous triangular stamp depicting the yeti.

To visit the temple, one must first cross the Pachhu (Paro River) over a suspension bridge built with iron chains.  Tachogang means “Temple of the Hill of the Excellent Horse” and was built in the 14th century by Thangtong Gyalpo after he had a vision of the spiritual horse Balaha, an emanation of Avalokiteshvara, while meditating. The myth says that he then decided to build a temple with one of his famous iron chain constructions on the present site. The original bridge was washed away by floods in 1969 and was restored in 2005. Thangtong Gyalpo was a famous architect who is said to have built 108 iron bridges throughout Tibet and Bhutan.</p>\n          <br />\n          <h2 className='font-bold'>Chhimphu Lhakhang</h2>\n          <br />\n          <p>This temple is located high in the Dotey valley and is about 4 hour walk from the nearest road head.The temple is dedicated to Dorje Phagmo.

The local mythology related to declaring takin as the national animal of Bhutan is dated to the 15th century. The popular Tibetan saint Drukpa Kunley, also known as “The Divine Madman” is credited with creating the takin with its unique features. Drukpa Kunley, who was not only a religious preacher but also a proficient tantric, was requested by the people of Bhutan during one of his religious lectures to conjure a miracle before them. The saint agreed to do so provided he was fed for lunch, a whole cow and a whole goat. Once served, he devoured the food of both animals and left out the bones. He then took out the head of the goat and fixed it to the skeleton of the cow and uttered some magic words. With a snap, he created a live animal, which had the head of the goat and the body of the cow. The animal sprang up and moved on to the meadows to graze. The animal was then given the name dong gyem tsey (takin).</p>\n          <br />\n          <h2 className='font-bold'>Sangaygang</h2>\n          <br />\n          <p>This is the hilltop above Thimphu with the BBS tower on top.

At age forty, Phajo arrived in Bhutan where he stayed for twenty-eight years until his death at Tango hermitage. Pha-jo, during a meditation at Taksang (Tigers Nest Monastery in Paro) had a vision where he was told by Guru Rinpoche that he should establish four fortresses (dzongs), four hermitages (phug) and four cliff top meditation sites (drag), which he achieved during his lifetime. Along side Tango Monastery near Thimphu, the meditation site known as Thugs-je-drag (Thuji Lhakhang) above the present day Phajoding Monastery is considered to bare the most spiritual significance for Buddhists out of the twelve sacred sites that he established.</p>\n          <br />\n          <h2 className='font-bold' >Thuji Lhakang</h2>\n          <br />\n          <p>It was at this site where Phajo meditated for one month and at the end had a vision of Chenrezig; the Buddha of compassion. In order to ascertain whether his teachings would spread across the whole region of Bhutan it is said that he placed his walking stick into the cliff face where he meditated and if his teachings were to spread, water would emerge from the rock face, which it subsequently did. This sacred water known as ‘drub chu’ is still flowing from the cliff face and is famous throughout the whole of Bhutan for curing people with speech impediments.</p>\n          <br />\n          <h2 className='font-bold' >Druk Wangyal Khang Zhang Chortens (108 Chorten)</h2>\n          <br />\n          <p>The Druk Wangyal Khang Zhang Chortens are red-band or khangzang chortens, 108 in numbers, built in a central hillock at the pass, under the patronage of the Queen Ashi Dorji Wangmo Wangchuk.

It is so sacred that the Tibetans attacked Punakha Dzong in 1639 to get it back but the Bhutanese successfully repelled them. A Gongkhang was built to commemorate the victory: Yu Gyal Gongkhang Chen Mo “the great shrine of the protective and victorious lord”. Punakha Dzong served as the seat of the government until the second king. The central monastic body still resides in Punakha during winter.

He subdued a demoness with his magic “thunderbolt” (phallus) and built a chorten at the same spot. The demoness used to terrorize travellers crossing Dochu la. In 1499 the 14th Drukpa hierarch Ngawang Chogyel built the extended temple. The statue of Kunley, in a monk’s robe, is centrally located at the altar, in a reclining position with a ceramic statue of his dog Sachi. The phallus symbol, associated with this famous saint, can be found painted on house walls to ward off evil spirits. As wooden symbol crossed with a sword, it can be seen dangling from all four corners of roofs. Furthermore a blessing by several wooden phalli in Chime lhakhang shall help childless women to get pregnant.</p>\n          <p>Drukpa Kuenley is a highly popular religious figure in Bhutan. Historically, he was known for his unorthodox ways of teaching Buddhism by singing, humour and outrageous sexual behaviour, which amounted to being bizarre and even shocking. He mocked the secular and religious establishment, railed against commonplace morality and conventionalism, and lashed out against the narrow-mindedness of people. The “divine madman” by his anomalous and erratic behaviour spotlights the absurdity of all fixed, man-made rules and prescriptions (fundamentalisms).</p>\n          <br />\n          <h2 className='font-bold' >Nalanda Buddhist Institute / Daley Gonpa</h2>\n          <br />\n          <p>Nalanda Buddhist Institute, also known locally as Daley Goenpa or Dalida, is a Buddhist monastic school.

Zhabdrung concluded that the old man was Yeshey Goenpo (Mahakala) and sent a noble to study the location. The noble reported that he saw four ravens circling the ridge, which flew away in four different directions when he approached. Taking this to be a good omen, Zhabdrung constructed the dzong in 1638.</p>\n          <p>The Dzong burned down in 2012 and is under re-construction in traditional style and manner.</p>\n          <br />\n          <h2 className='font-bold' >Baylangdra Ney</h2>\n          <br />\n          <p>This sacred place is located on a cliff, around an hour’s drive from Chuzomsa and half an hour’s walk from the road point.
